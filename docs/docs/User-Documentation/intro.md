# Intro

This section will focus on guiding you throough the build process, the **User Documentation** is structured like a **How-To Guide** and does not provide a lot of explanation of how the project **works under the hood**.
If you are interested in deeply understanding the project you should checkout the **Contributor Documentation**!

## What you should prepare for

Now its time to really get your hands dirty on the Project, you will find yourself running a 3D Printer, soldering your components together and uploading the source code to a Microcontroller!

You Prepare your work station a bit, make sure to have enough space, a well ventilated room and all the components you need. Sort them before you start with the Project, work with the Mis En Place principle!
