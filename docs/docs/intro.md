# Welcome!
Welcome to the Grunduino Community! Since you are reading this text i can confidentally say, that **you** are interested to automate your manual coffee grinder.
And don't worry if you are not a electronics or software geek, with the how-to guides everyone is able to complete this project! 


In this section we will together discover how to use this documentation and what parts will be relevant for you 

## It starts with you!

There are two different paths you can take when building the project and reading this Documentation, there is the **User** Documentation and the **Contributor** Documentation.

If you dont mind implementation details and dont want to fully understand the project but you want to motorize your Coffee Hand-Grinder and build this project at home you are a **User**.

If you want to fully understand the project and add your own taste to it you are a **Contributor**! What feature do you want to implement? It could be **anything!** Maybe there is a feature that you think is cool or really anything you think the project could benefit from.

The **User** Documentation is structured like a **How-To Guide** it guides you from Manual to electric Coffee-Grinder and gives you everything you need to know if you want to motorize our Grinder

The **Contributors** Documentation is a more in depth documentation, it serves you with implementation details and explanations of how the project works under the hood. It basically guides you to the level of knowledge that you can confidentally develop your own features and add value to the project!



## What everyone needs

Before you take the one or the other path, there are certain things that remain the same for both **User** and **Contributor**. That for example is a list of materials, It doesn't matter if you want to develop your own features or just use the project, the materials you need to purchase remain the same. Those kind of Contents can be found outside of the **User** and **Contributor** paths. So before you go into one of the Documentations on the side-bar menu, make sure to have checked the other sections before.
