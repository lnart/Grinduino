# Features and Compatibility

# Features

Essentially the Grinduino Project brings you from **manual** coffee grinder to a fully **motorized**  one.
But the project equips your coffee setup with more than only a motor to save your power and time in the morning!

The **Grinduino** project also implements control over the **speed** of your Grinder so you can effectively tell the Grinder to Grind your coffee between the range of **1-220 RPM**.

Another core feature is the **Dosing control**, the project implements a scale that is accurate to **two decimal points** to ensure you always get the exact yield that you want.

Moreover the project gives you a lot of **flexibility** in how you want to brew your coffee! Imagine you have a dark roasted espresso from Brazil, one lighter roasted from Tanzania and one very special Coffee that you only drink on certain occasions. For all of those coffees you need a different Grind-Size and therefore 3 different Grinders, having 3 big Coffee-Grinders in your kitchen seems kind of ridiculous. Having 3 handgrinders and swap them in and out of the Grinduino stand is much more realistic, affordable and takes much less space, so the project gives you a lot of flexibility without to sacrifice any features.

# Compatibility

The Project is designed to fit **any modern Hand-Grinder**, there are cetainly exceptions to it but as long as your Grinder is smaller than HEIGHT PLACEHOLDER and is not bigger than a scope of SCOPE PLACEHOLDER the project will work with your Grinder.
You don't have to worry about the rod of your hand grinder, the project fits any rod and is adjustable individually. Just make sure that your rod is not wider than CIRCUMFERENCE PLACEHOLDER.
Other than that there is nothing to worry about so **lets start Tinkering!**
