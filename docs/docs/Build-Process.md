# Build Process

Maybe you have wondered, *hmm how does the timeline of the project look like*, or *Do i have the skills to do this project*.
This Page gives you an Idea of the Build process and the skills that it requires to complete this project. 

## Prerequisites

Even if you don't need a deep understanding of Software or Electronics, there are some things you need to bring to the table.
Of course you need the equipment like an soldering iron or a 3D-Printer or at least access to it. You need to have a laptop or computer and you should have very basic soldering knowledge. 
**Don't** let that intimidate you, i've also learned soldering on youtube and a project like this can also teach you soldering, so take the challenge and learn it. It wont take a long time to learn and its another **skill** on your resume!

## Setup and Order

1. Identify Grinder Compatibility
    In the beginning i've said that almost any Grinder will fit, and that is true. However there might be exceptions so just check if your Grinder is compatible.
2. Determine your learning path 
    Understand what a **User** and **Contributor** is and decide which one you want to be.
3. Select and order Components
    Order components based on the country you are living in. You dont have to order via my link. Maybe you have a great Hardware store in your city or you found a cheaper alternative. Just be sure that the product matches the    project requirements, if you know about electronics you can use whatever parts you want but if you are new to it i would advise to stick to the table of materials.

## Components arrived, time to solder!

4. Follow along the documentation and solder your components together.

## System is Soldered! Upload the Code

5. Now that the parts are connected you can upload the source code to the brain of the system.

## Testing

6. Test the project and make sure everything works as intended

## Final Assembly

7. Print all your Parts and assemble them together

## Celebrate and share your Success
8. Your project is done, Grind your first coffee and share it on our Discord channel in the #firs-grind thread
