# Welcome 

You have chosen the path of being a **Contributor** and to understand the project on a deeper level!
I will explain certain things and i will do my best to convey my knowledge but you have to bring some prerequisites, 
this is not a **Software Engineering** or **Electronics** course, i assume that you have very **basic knowledge** in those domains since
it will be required to follow along.

## What can you expect from this Documentation?
I will provide Explanations in different forms like in plain text, Diagrams, Photos or even Videos.
The Goal is for you to understand the Project on a level that you can start working on it when you have finished the Materials

## Order
Theoretically you can read the **User** docs first and then the **Contributor** docs, or the other way around.
Both are standalone documentations with a different goal, if you intent to read the **Contributor** docs anyway, 
I would suggest reading them before you build the product along with reading the **User** docs because then you will
understand what you are doing along the way and it'll be much more fun to build!

## What if you get stuck
If the **Contributor** docs bring you to a point where you don't know whats happening anymore and you feel lost, take a break, make a step back
Focus on the basics and try to learn what you don't understand.
It's absolutely okay and encouraged to maybe watch some Youtube tutorials or read articles that help you understanding these docs
